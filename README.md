## Overview
Everything has two sides, and so it is in Web3. On one side lies a paradise of innovation, while the other remains a dark forest.

Octopus Anonymous Community, built on Walrus, is a beam of light piercing through that darkness.

Facing real-world pressures, we cannot expect every whistleblower to be a mighty angel of justice—they need protection and anonymity too. None of the familiar, KYC-bound centralized blogging platforms can offer this.

We aim to let decentralized storage shine where it truly belongs. The advantage is that Octopus Anonymous Community is inherently a potential traffic hub—just one spark could ignite it. And in the Web3 world, rife with scams and rugs, there’s never a shortage of explosive news.

Who says anonymity kills social interaction? We’re redefining engagement with MindShare to burn SocialFi. Our long-term vision is to leverage tokenomics for decentralized content governance, creating a platform that fosters both freedom and accountability—a space where truth thrives while misinformation fades.

This is a bold experiment—one that makes dark forest of  Web3 a little less dark.

## **Core Values**
1. Anonymous disclosure, Secure Storage
With the help of blockchain features, it ensures that the user's identity is anonymous, making real information storage carefree.
2. Content Monetization × SocialFi – Incentivizing Quality
Followers can reward creators (e.g., via tipping) while earning tradable MindShare, letting valuable insights flowing.
3. Decentralized Governance

## Ways to Build Functions
Frontend: Integrated Sui Wallet for decentralized login, enabling identity verification via wallet signatures.

Smart Contracts: Developed Key Management Contracts on Sui Move, supporting share minting and trading (Buy/Sell/Transfer)

Decentralized Storage Layer: Hosts static frontend files (HTML/JS/CSS) and user-submitted content on Walrus, ensuring censorship resistance
